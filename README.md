# ðŸŽ¬ Highest performing movies SQL Analysis Project

This is built as a learning project using SQL/Power BI skills â€” not to represent work done for any studio or client.
The analysis is designed to find insights about budget, revenue, production companies, and genre-based profitability 
in top-performing movies to help with data-informed decisions.
